## Light/Dark Mode Template

This is an interactive Light/Dark Mode Website Template built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project allows users to toggle between light and dark themes, which dynamically changes the website's appearance. The theme preference is saved in localStorage, ensuring the theme persists even after the page is reloaded.


### Installation
- Clone the repo using git clone.
- Open the index.html file directly in a browser or use VS Code with the Live Server extension for real-time editing and viewing.
- The light/dark mode toggle functionality is controlled by JavaScript, and changes will reflect immediately in your browser as you interact with the button.
